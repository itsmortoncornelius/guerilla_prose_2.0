# guerilla_prose_2.0
A new implementation of a great idea (4 years after the first one)

## What's a guerilla prose
A _Guerilla Prose_ is meant to be a combination of an image and a text. 
* "Prose" suggests that the text is somehow artistic though prose should not be the only text category to be shared. It is in any case not more than 333 characters long and inspired by the Japanese Haiku. The text is meant to be short!
* "Guerilla" wants to give the whole text a connection to places out there, the dark or colorful corners of the city or the hidden places in the forest which inspired the shared text. The image is meant to make the creation process of the text comprehensible.
